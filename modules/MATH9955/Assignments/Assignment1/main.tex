\begin{abstract}
The \emph{parking problem} was proposed by Alfred R\'{e}nyi in 1958 - cars, modelled 
as unit intervals, are placed at random upon a street of length $x$ until no spaces 
that can accommodate cars remain. R\'{e}nyi showed that the \emph{jamming limit}, or 
expected coverage of cars on the street, is approximately $75\%$.\bigskip

As well as being an interesting problem in it's own right, applications of the parking 
problem are numerous in physics and chemistry. One of the most interesting applications 
is in the theory of \emph{Random Sequential Adsorption}, or RSA, which models the 
surface deposition of particles upon a substrate.\bigskip

There are a number of approaches to this problem in one dimensions. In this paper we 
will look at three of the approaches - an elementary treatment, an approach that makes 
use of Laplace Transforms, and the kinetic approach that looks at the time evolution 
of the line filling process.\bigskip

We will also look at a number of different generalizations of the problem, including 
\emph{parking with overlap}, also know as \emph{cooperative} RSA, and 
\emph{the reversible parking problem}, where cars arrive and leave at different rates.
